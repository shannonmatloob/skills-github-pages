~~Five~~ Seven years ago today, I took a one-way flight from JFK to LAX. I hadn't been able to find a job as a web developer or junior software engineer, and there was virtually no affordable health insurance available for chronically ill freelancers like myself in New York, so I decided to stay with my parents in California while I got back on my feet. I told myself it was temporary and that I would be back. I was wrong.

To be continued?
